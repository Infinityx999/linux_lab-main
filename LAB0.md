# Dual-boot Ubuntu ‚Äî Step-by-step tutorial 

> **Warning:** Dual-booting modifies partitions and bootloaders. A single wrong command may make data inaccessible. **Back up** all important data first (external drive, cloud). This tutorial explains manual steps and includes a *safe helper script* that only gathers information and guides you ‚Äî it will not perform destructive partition changes unless you explicitly confirm.

## 1) Goals and assumptions

- You want to install Ubuntu alongside an existing OS (usually Windows) on the same machine and be able to choose at boot.
- This guide assumes:
  - You have a modern PC using BIOS (legacy) *or* UEFI. Steps differ slightly ‚Äî pay attention to UEFI notes.
  - You can boot from USB and change boot order in firmware (BIOS/UEFI) settings.
  - You understand how to boot into firmware/BIOS and can access Disk Management (Windows) or GParted (Linux live).

---

## 2) Prerequisites checklist

- ‚úÖ External backup of personal files (required)
- ‚úÖ A USB stick (4 GB+ for server, 8 GB+ recommended for desktop ISO)
- ‚úÖ Ubuntu ISO downloaded (desktop image) ‚Äî verify checksum if possible
- ‚úÖ Rufus (Windows) or `dd` / `balenaEtcher` / `gnome-disks` (Linux) to make bootable USB
- ‚úÖ Enough free disk space to create root (`/`) partition (20‚Äì40 GB recommended) and optional swap/home
- ‚úÖ Time and patience

---

## 3) High-level plan

1. Back up everything.
2. Make a bootable USB with the Ubuntu ISO.
3. Shrink your existing OS partition (if needed) to free space.
4. Boot the Ubuntu live USB and run the installer ‚Äî create partitions in the free space.
5. Install the bootloader (GRUB) to the correct target (UEFI: the system EFI partition; BIOS: the disk MBR).
6. Reboot and choose the OS from the GRUB menu.

## 4) Full step-by-step manual instructions

### A ‚Äî Backup (do not skip)

- Copy Documents, Pictures, important profiles, browser bookmarks, and any activation keys to an external drive.
- If you have BitLocker (Windows), decrypt or suspend it before resizing partitions.

### B ‚Äî Prepare a bootable USB

**Windows users:** Use Rufus.
1. Download Rufus (rufus.ie).
2. Select the Ubuntu ISO and the USB device.
3. For UEFI machines use GPT + FAT32; for BIOS use MBR.
4. Create the USB.

### C ‚Äî Shrink Windows partition (if you have Windows)

1. Boot into Windows.
2. Open Disk Management (`diskmgmt.msc`).
3. Right-click the Windows (C:) partition ‚Üí **Shrink Volume**.
4. Choose how much space to free (20‚Äì40 GB or more). Apply.

If Windows refuses to shrink enough, disable hibernation and pagefile temporarily:

```powershell
# Run as admin in PowerShell
powercfg /h off
```

Then reboot and retry shrinking.

### D ‚Äî Boot live USB and create partitions

1. Insert the Ubuntu USB and boot from it (choose "Try Ubuntu" first if you want to test hardware).
2. Launch *GParted* (if not installed, you can open `gnome-disks` or use the installer partitioner).
3. In the freed space create the following (example):
   - `Root` (`/`) partition ‚Äî ext4, 30‚Äì50 GB
   - `Swap` ‚Äî either a swap file created later (preferred) or a swap partition (1‚Äì8 GB depending on RAM and hibernation needs)
   - Optional `Home` (`/home`) partition ‚Äî ext4, rest of the space if you want separation

**UEFI note:** Keep the existing EFI System Partition (ESP) ‚Äî do NOT format it. Mount it as `/boot/efi` during install.

### E ‚Äî Run Ubuntu installer

1. Start the installer.
2. When asked for Installation type choose **Something else** (manual partitioning) for control.
3. Assign mount points:
   - Select the ext4 partition ‚Üí edit ‚Üí use as ext4 ‚Üí mount point `/` ‚Üí format as ext4 (only if you want to erase anything there)
   - If using EFI, choose the existing EFI partition (vfat) and set mount point `/boot/efi` ‚Äî do NOT format unless you know what you're doing.
4. Device for bootloader installation:
   - UEFI: typically your main disk (e.g. `/dev/nvme0n1`) ‚Äî installer will install GRUB into the EFI.
   - BIOS: choose the disk's MBR (e.g. `/dev/sda`).

5. Proceed with the installation and reboot when finished.

### F ‚Äî First boot & GRUB troubleshooting

- After reboot you should see the GRUB menu listing Ubuntu and Windows. If you boot straight into Windows, try the following:
  - Enter firmware/BIOS -> Boot order -> select Ubuntu/GRUB (or disable Windows Boot Manager priority).
  - If that fails: Boot from USB again, choose "Try Ubuntu" ‚Üí install and run `boot-repair` (see Troubleshooting below).


---





## 5) Troubleshooting and tips

- **No GRUB menu, boots straight to Windows:** Check UEFI Boot Order (disable Windows Boot Manager or move Ubuntu/GRUB up). If required, use `boot-repair`:
  - Boot live USB ‚Üí `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y boot-repair` ‚Üí run `boot-repair`.
- **Windows not visible in GRUB:** In Ubuntu run `sudo update-grub`.
- **Cannot boot live USB on UEFI:** Ensure the USB is FAT32 and supports UEFI or disable Secure Boot temporarily.
- **Wanted to use LVM or full-disk encryption?** You can choose these during the installer (advanced); full disk encryption is powerful but increases complexity for recovery.

## 6) References & further reading

- Ubuntu official installation guide ‚Äî follow Ubuntu's pages for the particular release you use.
- Rufus documentation for creating UEFI-bootable USBs.

## 7) Check if ubuntu is installed correctly 

## lsb_release -a (shows Ubuntu version).
```bash
lsb_release -a 
```

## uname -a (gives info about the kernel).
```bash
uname -a 
```

## df -h - Shows disk usage.
```bash
df -h 
```

## free -m - Shows memory usage.
```bash
free -m 
```

### REFLECTION ON THE INSTALLATION 

## PROBLEMS FACED BY ME 
- Windows partition fails to shrink , happens if there are unmovable files. Workaround: disable hibernation & fast startup in Windows, defragment, then shrink.
- Fast Startup / Hibernation locks NTFS partition ,causes Ubuntu to mount Windows partitions read-only or not at all. Fix: disable Fast Startup in Windows power options
- BitLocker encryption blocking Ubuntu access ,if BitLocker is on, Ubuntu may not read the Windows disk until you unlock/decrypt it. Suspend BitLocker before dual-boot.




## Extra Question 
## What are two advantages of dual booting instead of using a VM?


## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Full Hardware Performance
- In a dual-boot setup, Ubuntu (or any OS) runs directly on your hardware.
- You get the full power of your CPU, GPU, and RAM without the virtualization overhead.


## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Better Hardware Compatibility & Access
- Dual boot allows direct access to your hardware ‚Äî Wi-Fi cards, USB devices, external drives, and graphics drivers.
- Some devices (like NVIDIA GPUs or advanced USB controllers) can be tricky or limited inside a VM.


## üí° Bonus thought: dual boot also gives you the real experience of using that OS as your daily driver, not just inside a ‚Äúsandbox.‚Äù
