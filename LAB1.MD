# üêö Shell Scripting Basics

## What is a Shell Script?
- A **shell script** is a text file containing commands to be executed by the shell.
- Automates repetitive tasks.

---

## 2. Creating Your First Shell Script

1. Create a file:
   ```bash
   nano hello.sh
   ```

2. Add:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # This is a simple shell script

   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

3. Save and exit (`CTRL+O`, `CTRL+X`).

4. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x hello.sh
   ```

5. Run it:
   ```bash
   ./hello.sh
   ```

**Output:**
```bash
Hello, World!
```

---

## 3. Variables in Shell

```bash
#!/bin/bash

name="Nidhish"
age=18

echo "My name is $name"
echo "I am $age years old"
```

**Output:**
```bash
My name is Nidhish
I am 18 years old
```

---

## 4. Taking User Input

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter your name:"
read username

echo "Hello, $username! Welcome to shell scripting."
```

**Sample Run:**
```bash
Enter your name:
Nidhish
Hello, Nidhish! Welcome to shell scripting.
```

---

## 5. Conditional Statements (if-else)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number:"
read num

if [ $num -gt 10 ]
then
    echo "The number is greater than 10"
else
    echo "The number is 10 or smaller"
fi
```

**Sample Run:**
```bash
Enter a number:
12
The number is greater than 10
```

## EXTRA QUESTIONS
## 1) What is the difference between chmod and chown?

## chmod - change mode:
- Used to change the permissions (read, write, execute) of a file or directory.
```bash
# chmod example
chmod 755 script.sh
```

## Chown- change owner;
- Used to change the owner or group of a file or directory.
```bash 
# chown example
sudo chown nidhish:developers script.sh
```


## 2) How do you check current directory and user?
## Display current directory;
- Use pwd to print the full path of the current working directory
```bash
pwd
```

## Display current user:
- Use whoami to print the current username:
```bash
whoami
```
